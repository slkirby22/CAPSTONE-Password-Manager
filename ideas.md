**Ideas for Improvement**

1. Shared user passwords.
2. Ability to lock user accounts (delete and unlock already exist).
3. Multi-Factor Authentication and/or Windows Single Sign On.
4. Add a password generation tool and further password validation.
5. Enforce session expiration via session.permanent.
6. Change login error messages to a generic message, such that it does not reveal whether or not a user exists.
7. Register security headers after each request.
8. Add audit logging to API functions.
